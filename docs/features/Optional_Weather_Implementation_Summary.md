# Optional Weather Pipeline - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The pipeline has been successfully modified to support training with **ONLY flight features**, completely skipping weather data processing when weather features are not configured.

## What Changed

### 1. FeatureExtractionConfig.scala ✅
**File**: `src/main/scala/com/flightdelay/config/FeatureExtractionConfig.scala`

**Changes**:
- Added helper method `isWeatherEnabled: Boolean` (line 42)
- Returns `true` only if `weatherSelectedFeatures` exists AND is non-empty
- Already had `weatherSelectedFeatures: Option[Map[...]]` - no change needed

**Usage**:
```scala
if (experiment.featureExtraction.isWeatherEnabled) {
  // Process weather data
} else {
  // Skip weather processing
}
```

---

### 2. DataPipeline.scala ✅
**File**: `src/main/scala/com/flightdelay/data/DataPipeline.scala`

**Changes**:
- **Return type changed**: `(DataFrame, DataFrame)` → `(DataFrame, Option[DataFrame])`
- **Conditional weather processing** (lines 28-69):
  - ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Checks if ANY **ENABLED** experiment needs weather: `configuration.enabledExperiments.exists(_.featureExtraction.isWeatherEnabled)`
  - If `true`: loads and preprocesses weather data → returns `Some(weather)`
  - If `false`: skips steps 3/4/5 (weather loading, WBAN, weather preprocessing) → returns `None`
- **Schema validation and caching**: handles `Option[DataFrame]` for weather

**Impact**:
- Weather data loading is skipped entirely when not needed
- Saves significant processing time and memory
- Clear logging indicates when weather is disabled

---

### 3. FeaturePipeline.scala ✅
**File**: `src/main/scala/com/flightdelay/features/FeaturePipeline.scala`

**Changes**:
- **Parameter changed**: `weatherData: DataFrame` → `weatherData: Option[DataFrame]` (line 12)
- **Conditional join and explode** (lines 24-71):
  ```scala
  val dataForML = weatherData match {
    case Some(weather) =>
      // Perform join and explode as before
      val joinedData = join(flightData, weather, experiment)
      val explodedData = explose(joinedData, experiment)
      explodedData

    case None =>
      // Skip join and explode - use flight data only
      val selectedFlightData = flightData.select(flightFeatures: _*)
      selectedFlightData
  }
  ```

**Impact**:
- No join operation when weather is disabled
- No explode operation when weather is disabled
- Directly saves flight features only to parquet

---

### 4. FlightDelayPredictionApp.scala ✅
**File**: `src/main/scala/com/flightdelay/app/FlightDelayPredictionApp.scala`

**Changes**:
- **DataPipeline call** (lines 76-83): handles `Option[DataFrame]` return type with pattern matching
- **Weather loading from parquet** (lines 91-99): conditionally loads weather based on `isWeatherEnabled`
- **runExperiment signature** (line 165): `weatherData: DataFrame` → `weatherData: Option[DataFrame]`

**Impact**:
- Main app correctly propagates `Option[DataFrame]` throughout the pipeline
- Clear logging shows when weather is enabled/disabled

---

### 5. ConfigurationBasedFeatureExtractorPipeline.scala ✅
**File**: `src/main/scala/com/flightdelay/features/pipelines/ConfigurationBasedFeatureExtractorPipeline.scala`

**Changes**:
- **No changes needed!** Already handles missing weather features correctly:
  - Line 38: `weatherSelectedFeatures.getOrElse(Map.empty)` - returns empty map if None
  - Line 83: `findMatchingColumns` returns `Seq.empty` for missing features
  - Line 89-106: `flatMap` automatically filters out empty sequences

**Impact**:
- Feature extraction works seamlessly with or without weather features
- No errors when weather features are absent

---

## How to Use

### Configuration Without Weather Features

Simply **omit** or **comment out** the `weatherSelectedFeatures` section in your YAML config:

```yaml
experiments:
  - name: "Flight-Only-Experiment"
    description: "Training with flight features only"
    enabled: true
    target: "label_is_delayed_15min"

    featureExtraction:
      type: "feature_selection"
      storeJoinData: false
      storeExplodeJoinData: false
      weatherDepthHours: 0  # Ignored
      maxCategoricalCardinality: 50

      flightSelectedFeatures:
        CRS_DEP_TIME:
          transformation: "None"
        OP_CARRIER_AIRLINE_ID:
          transformation: "StringIndexer"
        # ... other flight features

      # weatherSelectedFeatures: {}  ← OMIT or set to empty map
```

### Configuration With Weather Features

Include `weatherSelectedFeatures` with at least one feature:

```yaml
    featureExtraction:
      weatherDepthHours: 3

      flightSelectedFeatures:
        # ... flight features

      weatherSelectedFeatures:
        feature_weather_severity_index:
          transformation: "None"
        # ... other weather features
```

## Pipeline Behavior Comparison

| Aspect | With Weather Features | Without Weather Features |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Weather loading** | ✅ Loads weather CSV files | ⚠️ **SKIPPED** |
| **Weather preprocessing** | ✅ Preprocesses weather data | ⚠️ **SKIPPED** |
| **WBAN mapping** | ✅ Loads WBAN-Airport mapping | ⚠️ **SKIPPED** |
| **Flight-Weather join** | ✅ Performs join | ⚠️ **SKIPPED** |
| **Weather array explode** | ✅ Explodes observations | ⚠️ **SKIPPED** |
| **Feature extraction** | Flight + Weather features | Flight features only |
| **Output parquet** | `joined_exploded_data.parquet` | `joined_exploded_data.parquet` (flight only) |

## Logs to Expect

### When Weather is Enabled:
```
[DataPipeline] Weather features required: true

[Step 1/5] Loading raw flight data...
[Step 2/5] Preprocessing flight data...
[Step 3/5] Loading raw weather data...
[Step 4/5] Loading WBAN-Airport-Timezone mapping...
[Step 5/5] Preprocessing weather data...

[FeaturePipeline] Weather features enabled - performing join and explode
[Step 1/2] Join flight & Weather data...
[Step 2/2] Exploding Joined flight & Weather data...
```

### When Weather is Disabled:
```
[DataPipeline] Weather features required: false
⚠️  Weather features disabled - Skipping steps 3/4/5 (weather loading & preprocessing)

[FeaturePipeline] Weather features disabled - using flight data only (no join, no explode)
  - Selected 10 flight features
  - Flight records: 1,234,567
```

---

## Testing the Implementation

### Test 1: Run with Weather (Existing Config)
```bash
# Use existing local-config.yml with weather features
./work/scripts/spark-submit.sh
```

Expected: Pipeline runs normally with weather processing.

### Test 2: Run without Weather (New Config)
```bash
# Use the flight-only example config
./work/scripts/spark-submit.sh flight-only
```

Expected:
- Weather steps 3/4/5 skipped
- No join/explode operations
- Training completes successfully with flight features only

---

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Skip expensive weather processing when not needed
2. **Flexibility**: Easy A/B testing of flight-only vs flight+weather models
3. **Memory**: Reduced memory footprint for flight-only experiments
4. **Clarity**: Clear logging indicates what's being processed
5. **Safety**: Type-safe with `Option[DataFrame]` - no null pointer exceptions

## Regression Testing Checklist

- [ ] Experiment with weather features: works as before
- [ ] Experiment without weather features: skips weather pipeline
- [ ] Logs clearly indicate weather enabled/disabled
- [ ] No NullPointerExceptions
- [ ] Feature extraction works in both modes
- [ ] Model training completes successfully in both modes
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Only enabled experiments are checked for weather requirements

---

## ⚠️ Important Bug Fix

### Problem
Initial implementation had a critical bug where it checked **ALL experiments** (including disabled ones) to determine if weather processing was needed.

**Scenario**:
```yaml
experiments:
  - name: "Flight-Only"
    enabled: true    # ← ACTIVE
    # No weatherSelectedFeatures

  - name: "With-Weather"
    enabled: false   # ← DISABLED
    weatherSelectedFeatures:
      feature_weather_severity_index: ...
```

**Old behavior**: Weather processing would run because disabled experiment has weather features ❌
**New behavior**: Weather processing skipped because enabled experiment has no weather features ✅

### Fix
Changed from:
```scala
configuration.experiments.exists(_.featureExtraction.isWeatherEnabled)
```

To:
```scala
configuration.enabledExperiments.exists(_.featureExtraction.isWeatherEnabled)
```

**Files updated**:
- `src/main/scala/com/flightdelay/data/DataPipeline.scala` (line 29)
- `src/main/scala/com/flightdelay/app/FlightDelayPredictionApp.scala` (line 91)

---

**Status**: ✅ Implementation Complete (Bug Fixed)

All components have been updated to support optional weather processing. The pipeline now correctly checks **only enabled experiments** to determine if weather data processing is needed.
